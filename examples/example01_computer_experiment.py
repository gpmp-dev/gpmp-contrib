"""Example Script for ComputerExperiment Class

This script demonstrates the usage of the ComputerExperiment class
from the computerexperiment module.  The ComputerExperiment class is
designed for specifying and evaluating functions in a computer
experiment problem. Additionally, functions can be labeled as
objectives or constraints.

The script provides two examples:
1. Using separate objective and constraint functions.
2. Using a combined function that handles both objectives and
   constraints.

Each  example demonstrates  how to  initialize the  ComputerExperiment
object, how to evaluate functions, and how to handle constraints.
